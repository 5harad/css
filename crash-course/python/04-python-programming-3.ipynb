    "1. Define another `class`, **OnlineBookReader**, which inherits the **BookReader** `class`. The only difference between **BookReader** and **OnlineBookReader** is that **OnlineBookReader** takes a `URL` as a single argument when instantiated. The **OnlineBookReader** then downloads the specified `URL` locally, and uses the downloaded file when `count_words()` is called (all implemented in the `__init__` method)"
