# Wrangling Data with `dplyr`

## Introduction to `dplyr`
- `dplyr` is a package that provides a convenient framework (along with a
handful of useful functions) for wrangling data (frames)
- `dplyr` is a part of the `tidyverse`, so if you load `tidyverse`, `dplyr` is
also loaded
- You can also, but don"t have to, install and load the `dplyr` as a standalone
package like you  would any other `R` package
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install, if you haven"t already.
# Only need to do this once on a single machine.
install.packages("dplyr")
# load package into workspace
library("dplyr")
```

## Data Frames: Introduction
- Data frames are the primary representation of data in `R`
- You can think of a data frame as a two-dimensional *table* of data
- It helps your sanity to always think of data frames as a table where

```
Each column represents a variable/feature
Each row represents an observation/instance
```

- For example: student score data

ID   | name | age | score
-----|------|-----|------
1    | A    | 16  | 85
2    | B    | 17  | 89
3    | C    | 15  | 81


## Data Frames: First Impression
- We'll primarily use the `diamonds` data that's included with `tidyverse`
- Take a look by typing `diamonds` in the `R` console
- `diamonds` is a dataset containing the prices and other attributes of almost 
54,000 diamonds. Included variables are:
    - price, carat, cut, color, clarity, dimensions (x, y, z, depth, table)
    
- See documentation for more details 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?diamonds
```

## Verbs
- A *verb* in the world of `dplyr` is a function that 
    - takes a data frame as its first argument, and 
    - returns another data frame as a result
- For example, the `head()` function can be considered a verb
```{r, eval=FALSE}
head(diamonds, n = 3)
```
- Note that the result of the `head()` function is another data frame
(in this case, with 3 rows)
- The **core idea of `dplyr`** is that most of your data manipulation needs can
be satisfied with 5 basic verbs (or 4, depending on how you categorize them)

## Five basic verbs
- The five basic verbs of `dplyr` and associated actions are presented below

verb          | action
----          | ------
`filter()`    | select a subset of *rows* by specified conditions
`select()`    | select a subset of *columns*
`mutate()`    | create a *new column* (often from existing columns)
`arrange()`   | reorder (sort) *rows* by values of specified *column*(s)
`summarize()` | aggregate values and reduce to single value

- Some verbs have additional options or convenient wrappers

# Selecting rows (1/5)
## Selecting Rows: `filter()`
- Select a subset of *rows*
- Multiple conditions can be used
- Use `&` to specify `AND` conditions
- Use `|` to specify `OR` conditions
- `AND(&)`/`OR(|)` operations can be used together
(where default behavior for multiple conditions is `AND`)
```{r, eval=FALSE}
filter(diamonds, cut == "Ideal" & carat > 3)
filter(diamonds, carat <= .2 |  carat >= 3)
filter(diamonds,
       carat <= .2 |  carat >= 3, color == "D")
```
- Use `%in%` to match on a collection of values
```{r, eval=FALSE}
filter(diamonds, cut %in% c("Fair", "Ideal"))
```


## Selecting Rows: `slice()`
- To select rows by numerical index (position), use `slice()`
- For example, to select the first 10 rows
```{r, eval=FALSE}
slice(diamonds, 1:10)
```
- or to select the last 10 rows
```{r, eval=FALSE}
slice(diamonds, (n() - 9):n())
```
- Use `n()` inside a `dplyr` verb to to indicate the *number of rows* of the
data frame

# Selecting columns (2/5)
## Selecting Columns: `select()`
- Select a subset of *columns*
- Either specify the columns that you want to select
```{r, eval=FALSE}
select(diamonds, cut, price)
```
- Or specify the columns you wish to drop
```{r, eval=FALSE}
select(diamonds, -x, -y, -z)
```

## Selecting Columns: `select()` (cont'd)
- `dplyr` provides useful helper functions you can use to `select()` columns
that match specific criteria such as
    - `starts_with(x)`: names that start with `x`
    - `ends_with(x)`: names that end with `x`
    - `contains(x)`: names that contain `x`
    - `matches(x)`: names that match the (regular expression) `x`
- See the documentation for more details
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?dplyr::select
```
- While you can assign new column names with `select()` the convenience function
`rename()` lets you rename columns while retaining the rest of the data frame
```{r, eval=FALSE}
rename(diamonds, cut_type = cut)
```

# Creating new columns (3/5)
## Create New Columns: `mutate()`
- Create new columns, usually as a function of existing columns
- You can refer to new columns you just created, inside the same `mutate()`
function
```{r, eval=FALSE}
mutate(diamonds, 
       price_per_carat = price / carat,
       volume = x * y * z,
       # Use the volume column we just created
       # to create yet another price_per_volume column
       price_per_volume = price / volume
       )
```
- Use `transmute()` to create a new data frame *just from* the new column(s)
```{r, eval=FALSE}
transmute(diamonds, carat, 
          price_per_carat = price / carat)
```

# Sorting (4/5)
## Sorting Rows by Column Value: `arrange()`
- Reorder the rows of a data frame by the specified column"s value
- Multiple conditions are arranged from left to right
- Use `desc()` to arrange in descending order
```{r, eval=FALSE}
arrange(diamonds, carat, price)
arrange(diamonds, carat, desc(price))
arrange(diamonds, desc(carat), desc(price))
```

# Aggregating (5/5)
## Aggregate Data: `summarize()`
- Aggregate/collapse the data into a single row
- Think of as applying a function to columns
```{r}
summarize(diamonds, avg_price = mean(price))
```

## Recap:
- The five basic verbs: 

verb          | action
----          | ------
`filter()`    | select a subset of *rows* by specified conditions
`select()`    | select a subset of *columns*
`mutate()`    | create a *new column* (often from existing columns)
`arrange()`   | reorder (sort) *rows* by values of specified *column*(s)
`summarize()` | aggregate values and reduce to single value

- But what about ...
    - Average price of diamonds for each cut type?
    - Largest (carat) diamond in each color category?
    - ...

## Bad example:
- A natural, but tedious way to compute:
- Average price of diamonds for each cut type?
    - use `filter` to create five different data frames, one for each `cut` type
    - use `summarize` to compute the mean price for each data frame
- Largest (carat) diamond in each color category?
    - use `filter` to create seven different data frames, one for each 
    `color` category
    - use `arrange` to sort in descending order of `carat` for each data frame
    - use `slice` to get the first row from each of the `arrange`d data frames
    
- The pattern:
    - `group` `by` some categorical value
    - do some operations, but to each category of the `group`

## Split-Apply-Combine

## Grouped Operations
- If a data frame is *grouped*, operations are applied to each group separately,
and the results are combined back to a single data frame
- The `group_by()` verb lets you specify the *grouping* variables (e.g., `cut`, 
`color`)
```{r, results="hide"}
diamonds_by_cut <- group_by(diamonds, cut)
```
- When the data frame is `group_by`'d, all verbs/functions will operate as if 
each category of the grouping variable is its own data frame, e.g., 

verb | group specific action
---           | ---
`arrange()`   | sort rows within each group
`slice()`     | extract rows within each group
`summarize()` | aggregate values group-wise
`n()`         | count the number of rows in each group

## Grouped `slice()`
- Retrieve one diamond from each cut
```{r}
slice(diamonds_by_cut, 1)
```

## Grouped `summarize()`
- Retrieve (1) number of diamonds and (2) average price by cut type
```{r}
summarize(diamonds_by_cut,
          count = n(),
          avg_price = mean(price))
```

# Multiple (Chained) Operations

## Multiple (Chained) Operations
- Proportion of different `color`s in each `cut` category

- We can achieve the desired result with a few operations
    1. **`group_by`** `cut`
    2. **`mutate`** to create a column with total diamonds for each `cut`
    3. re-**`group_by`** `cut` and `color`
    4. Use the new column from above to `summarize` the proportion of each
    `color` within each `cut`

- Note that `dplyr` verbs do **not** modify the original data frame (i.e., they
don't have side effects)
    - This is generally a good thing, since it guarantees the integrity of your data
    - But it makes multiple operations on a data frame difficult

## Multiple Operations: The OK Way
- One way to perform multiple operations is to save intermediate data frames as
new data frames
- This method delivers desired results, but makes your workspace quite messy
(i.e., you"ll end up with a workspace full of intermediate results)
```{r, eval=FALSE}
by_cut <- group_by(diamonds, cut)
count_cuts <- mutate(by_cut, N = n())
by_cut_and_color <- group_by(count_cuts, cut, color)
proportions <- summarize(by_cut_and_color,
                         prop = mean(n()/N))
```
- This method might be prefered if you need the intermediate results in
the future
- If not, there is a better way to chain multiple operations with `dplyr`

## The Pipe Operator `%>%`
- The pipe operator, takes the output from its left-hand side, and uses it as
the first argument to whatever is on its right-hand side
- For example:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
by_cut <- group_by(diamonds, cut)
count_cuts <- mutate(by_cut, N = n())
```
is equivalent to 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
count_cuts <- diamonds %>% 
  group_by(cut) %>%  
  mutate(N = n())
```
(except in the second case, the `by_cut` data frame is never created)

## The Pipe Operator `%>%`
- Using the pipe, we can complete the entire task without saving any intermediate data frames
```{r, eval=FALSE}
proportions <- diamonds %>% 
  group_by(cut) %>% 
  mutate(N = n()) %>% 
  group_by(cut, color) %>% 
  summarize(prop = mean(n()/N))
```
- No need to save intermediate results
- Easier to read (i.e., you can follow the operations step-by-step without too
much mental accounting)

## `dplyr`: Exercise
- Find the most expensive diamond for each `cut`.
- How many 1 carat diamonds are "Premium" `cut`, and what are the min/median/max
prices?
- What is the average price for diamonds grouped by 0.1 `carat`s?

# Exercise Solution

## WARNING
- Solutions to the exercise are presented in the next slide
- Try the exercise before proceeding!

## Solutions
- Find the most expensive diamond for each `cut`.
```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  group_by(cut) %>% 
  arrange(desc(price)) %>% 
  slice(1)
```
- How many 1 carat diamonds are "Premium" `cut?
```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  filter(carat == 1, cut == "Premium") %>% 
  summarize(N = n(), min = min(price), med = median(price), max = max(price))
